# .NET logging with Serilog
This is an example project showing how to use Serilog for logging.

It uses [Serilog.AspNetCore](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore), which includes [Serilog.Sinks.File](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-file) and [Serilog.Settings.Configurations](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-settings-configuration/).

Configuration is located in [appsettings.json](https://github.com/thommelutten/dotnet-logging-with-serilog/blob/master/LoggingWithSerilog/appsettings.json) and setup located in [Program.cs](https://github.com/thommelutten/dotnet-logging-with-serilog/blob/master/LoggingWithSerilog/Program.cs).
